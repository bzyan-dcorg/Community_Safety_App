# Community-Safety-App

## Community Safety App: Product Concept & Feature List
### 1) Positioning
Shift from a “public safety only” app to a Community Intelligence & Sentiment platform. It includes criminal/police incidents and highly relevant non-police neighborhood issues (porch piracy, suspicious loitering, noise, missing pets, broken streetlights, road hazards, sanitation, etc.).
Officials can observe structured community signals to understand concerns and allocate resources.
### 2) Taxonomy (configurable)
Police-related: burglary, theft from auto, non-fatal shooting, homicide, suspicious vehicle/person, etc.


Community/Civic: package theft, mailbox tampering, noise/neighborhood disputes, lost/found pets, streetlight outage, potholes, sanitation/illegal dumping, homelessness encampments, etc.


Public order: street racing, fireworks, loud gatherings.


### 3) Reporting & Prompts 
Any resident can post text/photo/video; default status Unverified.


Contextual prompts vary by incident type (not mandatory):


“Is it still happening?” (Yes/No/Unsure)


“Contacted authorities?” (No / Service request / 911 / Not needed)


“Do you feel safe now?” (Yes/No/Unsure)


Time-based follow-ups (T+30m, T+2h/next day) to update status (ongoing → ended; contacted → responded; etc.).


Dedup/merge near-time, near-location, similar-content posts into one incident thread.


### 4) Credibility & Sentiment
Credibility score across community posts (agreement, reporter history, clarity, spatiotemporal consistency).


Community sentiment panel by topic (e.g., “package theft” or “streetlight outages”): trending, hotspots, resolution progress.


Official response tags: accepted/in progress/resolved → transparent close-the-loop visualizations.


### 5) Maps & Analytics (inclusive of non-police)
Cluster/Heat/Animated maps with filters for “include/exclude police-related”.


Trends by type/segment/time with rolling averages; emphasize civic issues too.


Optional lightweight sentiment analysis (privacy-first) for resident-friendly context.


### 6) Privacy & Safety
Default block-level geoprivacy (no house numbers by default).


Media redaction (faces/plates).


Moderation queue, anti-doxxing policy, and rate limits.


Anonymous/pseudonymous posts supported.


### 7) For Officials & Media
Subscriptions for weekly digests, heat areas, and category-specific reports.


Optional service ticket export/API to city systems.


Media access to de-identified trend summaries (with terms/consents).


### MVP Success Criteria

≥50% of discussion inputs come via guided prompts (structured).


≥30% of incidents include a safety sentiment response.


False-positive/merged-away rate < 10%.
